                <p>
                    Think of a website like a restaurant. Just as a restaurant has a dining area where you sit and a
                    kitchen where food is made,
                    a website has two main parts. The part you see and interact with (like the restaurant's dining room)
                    is called the frontend.
                    The part that works behind the scenes (like the kitchen) is called the backend. Let's explore how a
                    restaurant helps us
                    understand how websites work!

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h2>Front-End</h2>
                <p>
                    Think of the <strong>Front-End</strong> as the restaurant's dining room. It's everything you can see
                    and touch - the tables,
                    chairs, menus, and decorations. Just like how a restaurant needs to look nice and be easy to move
                    around in, a website needs
                    to look good and be easy to use. This is what you see in your web browser!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h2>Back-End</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Back-End</strong> is like the restaurant's kitchen. You don't see it, but it's where all
                    the important work happens.
                    Just like how chefs cook your food in the kitchen, the backend processes all your requests when you
                    use a website. It stores
                    information and makes sure everything works properly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>JavaScript</strong> is like your waiter or waitress. When you order food, the waiter takes
                    your order to the kitchen
                    and brings back your meal. Similarly, when you click a button on a website, JavaScript carries your
                    request to the backend
                    and brings back what you asked for. It helps make websites interactive!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h2>APIs</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>APIs</strong> are like food suppliers for the restaurant. Just as a restaurant gets
                    ingredients from different suppliers
                    (like a vegetable supplier or a meat supplier), websites use APIs to get special information from
                    other services. For example,
                    a weather website might use an API to get the latest weather information.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h2>Database</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Database</strong> is like the restaurant's storage room. Just as a restaurant stores
                    ingredients and supplies
                    they'll need later, a database stores information that the website needs. This could be things like
                    user accounts,
                    pictures, or any other information the website needs to remember.
                </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In summary, building a website is like running a restaurant. The front-end is what customers see and
                use,
                like the dining room. The back-end is the kitchen, where all the work happens out of sight. JavaScript
                is
                the helpful waiter, connecting the two. APIs bring in special ingredients from outside, and the database
                is the storage room for everything needed. When these parts work together, you get a smooth and
                enjoyable experienceâ€”just like a great meal at your favorite restaurant.
